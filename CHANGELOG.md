# Changelog

All notable changes to CatLLM will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.5] - 2026-03-23

### Added
- **Image summarization**: `summarize()` now supports image file inputs (`.jpg`, `.png`, etc.)
  with visual analysis via multimodal LLMs. Previously images only worked with `classify()`.
- **HuggingFace router suffix support**: Model names can now include a router suffix
  (e.g., `qwen/qwen3-vl-235b-a22b-instruct:novita`) to route requests to a specific
  HuggingFace Inference Provider (novita, together, sambanova, cerebras, fireworks).
  The suffix is automatically stripped from the model name before API calls.
- **`explore()` specificity improvement**: When `specificity="specific"`, category names now
  include detailed descriptions with examples (e.g., parenthetical clarifications) instead
  of bare labels.

### Fixed
- **`summarize()` JSON extraction**: Replaced `extract_json()` (which strips spaces, brackets,
  and newlines — fine for classification 0/1 output but destructive for freeform summary text)
  with a new `_extract_json_for_summary()` that preserves content. Also strips `<think>` tags
  from thinking models (Qwen3, DeepSeek).
- **`summarize()` array responses**: `extract_summary_from_json()` now handles models that
  return bullet-point summaries as JSON arrays (`{"summary": ["- point 1", "- point 2"]}`)
  instead of a single string.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-22

### Notes
- First stable release. All core features — classify, extract, explore, summarize,
  prompt_tune — are tested and production-ready.

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **`format` parameter on `summarize()`**: Controls the output structure of summaries. Default `"paragraph"`.
  - `"paragraph"` — flowing prose (default, existing behavior)
  - `"bullets"` — bullet-point list of key points
  - `"one-liner"` — single-sentence summary (auto-sets max_length=40)
  - `"structured"` — labeled sections: What, Who, Why, Impact
  - `"report"` — comprehensive full-page report with Overview, Background, Key Provisions, Stakeholders/Impact, and Implementation sections (auto-sets max_length=800)
  - Format instructions are prepended to any user-provided `instructions`. User `max_length` overrides the format default.

### Fixed
- **`summarize()` error handling**: Fixed a bug where `summarize_single_item()` ignored the error return from `client.complete()` in both the text and PDF code paths. The error was stored as `_err` (unused variable) instead of being checked, causing failed API calls to silently return empty summaries instead of being detected as failures. This meant the batch retry logic (2 additional passes × 5 retries each) never fired for summarization failures. Now properly checks `if error:` and returns the error, enabling the full retry pipeline (up to 15 total attempts per item).

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`prompt_tune` parameter on `classify()`**: Inline prompt optimization — runs
  `prompt_tune()` on a subsample before the full classification, then passes the
  optimized `system_prompt` automatically.
  - `prompt_tune=True`: Tune on 10 random items (default sample size).
  - `prompt_tune=N`: Tune on N random items.
  - `tune_iterations`, `tune_ui`, `tune_optimize` control the tuning behavior.
  - Tested on UCNets a19i data: **+5 pp** cell-level accuracy (89.8% → 94.8%)
    on 100 rows with Haiku 3.0, tuning on just 15 items.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`prompt_tune()` — Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO)**: Iteratively refines classification prompts using user feedback. Classifies a random sample, opens a browser-based review UI for corrections, then generates per-category instructions to improve accuracy. Uses coordinate-descent: one category at a time, worst-first, with full error context across all categories.
  - Browser UI (`_review_ui.py`): Self-contained HTML page with checkboxes for toggling category assignments. No external dependencies — uses Python's built-in `http.server` and `webbrowser`.
  - Terminal fallback (`ui="terminal"`): Text-based correction input for headless environments.
  - `optimize` parameter: Target metric — `"balanced"` (default, average of accuracy/sensitivity/precision), `"precision"`, or `"sensitivity"`.
  - `add_other` parameter: Auto-detects missing "Other" catch-all category, matching `classify()` convention.
  - Returns optimized `system_prompt` string that can be passed directly to `classify(system_prompt=...)`.
  - Only opens browser once (baseline). Subsequent iterations auto-score against saved ground truth.
- **`pilot_test` parameter on `classify()`**: Run a pilot classification on a small random sample before the full run. User reviews results and can cancel if accuracy is too low.
  - `pilot_test=True`: Test on 10 random items. `pilot_test=N`: Test on N items.
  - Uses the same browser review UI as `prompt_tune()`.
- **`system_prompt` parameter on `classify()`**: Custom system-level instruction prepended to classification prompts. Use `prompt_tune()` to generate an optimized one.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-20

### Added
- **`input_mode` parameter** on `classify()`, `summarize()`, and `extract()`: Separates _what you want the model to do_ from _what file type to process_. Two modes:
  - `"text"` — classify/summarize text content, regardless of source format. For images and scanned PDFs, uses LLM-based OCR to extract text first.
  - `"visual"` — classify/summarize visual features of images or rendered PDF pages.
  - `None` (default) — auto-select based on file type, preserving all existing behavior.
- **`input_type` parameter** on `classify()`, `summarize()`, and `extract()`: Explicit file type filter for directories/mixed input. Options: `"auto"` (default, auto-detect from extensions), `"pdf"`, `"image"`, `"docx"`, `"text"`.
- **LLM-based OCR** (`_ocr_extract_text()` in `text_functions_ensemble.py`): When `input_mode="text"` is used with image or PDF input, a multimodal LLM extracts visible text from the document before classification/summarization. OCR is performed once per item and shared across all ensemble models.
  - For PDFs: tries PyMuPDF text extraction first; if the page has no extractable text (scanned/image PDF), falls back to rendering the page as an image and OCR-ing it via LLM. Prints `[CatStack] Page has no extractable text. Using LLM-based OCR.`
  - For images: sends the image to the LLM with an OCR prompt.
  - Uses the first multimodal-capable model in the ensemble (skips text-only providers like Ollama).
  - Not supported with `batch_mode=True` (raises `ValueError`).
- **`_resolve_input_params()` internal function**: Resolves `input_mode`, `input_type`, and the legacy `mode` parameter into a unified `(resolved_mode, file_type, warnings)` tuple. Handles all backward compatibility:
  - Old `mode="image"/"text"/"both"` still works when `input_mode` is not set.
  - Emits a deprecation warning when both `input_mode` and `mode` are explicitly set.
  - Validates incompatible combinations (e.g., `input_mode="visual"` on text/DOCX input raises `ValueError`).
- **DOCX support in `summarize()`**: `summarize_ensemble()` now handles DOCX file auto-detection and text extraction, matching the existing behavior in `classify_ensemble()`.
- **Image support in `summarize()`**: `summarize_ensemble()` now loads and processes image files when detected, enabling image summarization.

### Changed
- **`extract()` default `input_type`** changed from `"text"` to `"auto"`. When set to `"auto"`, `extract()` calls `_detect_input_type()` to auto-detect the input format. Explicit `input_type="text"` still works as before.

---

## [2.10.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- **Robustness and batch features for `summarize()`**: Added `safety`, `max_retries`, `batch_retries`, `retry_delay`, `row_delay`, `fail_strategy`, `batch_mode`, `batch_poll_interval`, and `batch_timeout` parameters — achieving full parity with `classify()`.
  - **Safety incremental saves**: `safety=True` saves partial results to CSV after each row. New `_save_partial_summarize_results()` helper in `text_functions_ensemble.py`.
  - **Row delay**: `row_delay` pauses between processing rows for rate limit management.
  - **Fail strategy**: `fail_strategy="strict"` blanks the entire row if any model fails; `"partial"` (default) keeps successful results.
  - **Batch mode**: `batch_mode=True` submits summarization as async batch jobs for 50% cost savings. Supports single-model (`run_batch_summarize()`) and multi-model ensemble (`run_batch_ensemble_summarize()`) modes. PDF input raises an error (batch is text-only).
- **`_parse_batch_results()` parse_mode parameter**: Added `parse_mode="json"|"text"` to `_parse_batch_results()` in `_batch.py`. When `"text"`, skips `extract_json()` and returns raw text — needed for summarization batch results.
- **New batch summarization functions** in `_batch.py`: `_run_one_batch_summarize_job()`, `_run_one_sync_summarize_model()`, `run_batch_summarize()`, `run_batch_ensemble_summarize()`.
- **Example notebooks**:
  - `Summarizing Text and PDF Data.ipynb` — text/PDF summarization with all features
  - `Classifying Text with Local Models (Ollama).ipynb` — local model classification
  - `Ensemble Classification with Cloud and Local Models.ipynb` — ensemble patterns, temperature ensembles, parallel vs sequential execution, embedding tiebreaker
  - `Exploring Categories with explore().ipynb` — raw category extraction and saturation analysis
  - `Extracting Categories with extract().ipynb` — refined category extraction and classify workflow

### Fixed
- **`extract()` image/PDF dispatch bug**: `survey_question` was silently ignored for `input_type="image"` and `input_type="pdf"` — the code passed `description or ""` instead of the resolved survey question. Now correctly uses `resolved_survey_question` for all input types.

### Removed
- **Logprobs-based confidence scores** (`_confidence.py`): Removed the experimental logprobs feature due to unreliable behavior across providers. The module was never integrated into the public API.

---

## [2.9.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Embedding centroid tiebreaker** (`embedding_tiebreaker` parameter in `classify()`): Resolves true consensus ties (equal votes for 0 and 1) using embedding centroids built from unanimously-agreed rows. Compares tied texts to positive and negative centroids via cosine similarity. Adds `category_N_resolved_by` columns to output. Requires `pip install cat-llm[embeddings]`. Text input only, multi-model ensemble only, not supported in batch mode.
  - New parameter: `min_centroid_size` (int, default 3) — minimum unanimous rows needed to build centroids.
  - New internal module: `src/cat_stack/_tiebreaker.py`.

---

## [2.8.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **`claude-code` provider backend**: Added `claude-code` as a provider in `_providers.py`. Each LLM call shells out to `claude -p` (print mode), enabling the full catllm pipeline (retries, `extract_json()`, `categories_per_call`, threading) powered by the user's Claude Code token allowance with no API key. Use via `cat.classify(..., model_source="claude-code", user_model="sonnet")` from a standalone terminal or Python script. Not usable from within a Claude Code session (nested sessions blocked by CLI).
- **`check_claude_cli_available()`** utility function in `_providers.py` (re-exported via `text_functions.py`).

### Changed
- **`/catllm:classify` conversational redesign**: Replaced the rigid step-by-step questionnaire with a conversational-first flow. After finding the file, shows data preview and a single open-ended prompt ("What would you like to do with this data?"). Parses column, categories, model preference, and context from the user's free-text response. Only asks follow-ups for missing required parameters.
- **Smart API key auto-detection**: The classify skill now probes the environment for all known API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, xAI, HuggingFace) at startup. If found, mentions them proactively and defaults to cloud. If none found and ≤200 rows, defaults to Claude Code native mode.
- **Claude Code (Path B) hard-capped at 200 rows**: Native classification mode now enforces a strict 200-row limit instead of allowing users to proceed with a warning.
- API key validation in `text_functions.py` now skips `claude-code` provider (like Ollama).

---

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Claude Code classification mode in `/catllm:classify`**: Added "Claude Code (no API key)" as a third model location option alongside Cloud API and Ollama. When selected, Claude Code itself acts as the classifier — no API key or external setup needed. Supports natural-language input (e.g. `/catllm:classify survey.csv on the response column for positive, negative, neutral sentiment`), auto-discovers categories by reading data samples directly, and produces the same DataFrame output format as the API-based pipeline. Best for quick/casual classification of datasets under 200 rows. Cloud and Ollama options labeled as "core cat-llm pipeline, empirically validated" to distinguish from the native Claude Code mode.

---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **Chunked category classification** (`categories_per_call` parameter in `classify()`): Splits large category lists into smaller chunks, runs a separate LLM call per chunk with local 1..N numbering, and merges results back into global numbering. Reduces prompt complexity per call and can improve accuracy for large category sets (20+). Each chunk automatically gets a temporary "Other" catch-all category to give the LLM an escape hatch for ambiguous responses; the "Other" is dropped before merging. A unified "Other" column is added to the output when all real categories are 0 but at least one chunk flagged "Other". Not supported with `batch_mode=True`. Works with all input types (text, PDF, image), all providers, ensemble mode, and all prompting strategies.
  - New internal module: `src/cat_stack/_chunked.py` with `run_chunked_classification()` and `_run_single_chunk_call()`.

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-07

### Added
- **Sequential ensemble mode** (`parallel` parameter in `classify()`): Controls concurrent vs sequential model execution. Default `None` auto-detects: sequential for all-local models (Ollama), parallel for cloud providers. Set `parallel=True` to force concurrent execution or `parallel=False` to force sequential. Sequential mode is useful for resource-constrained environments or debugging.
- **Ollama support for `explore()` and `extract()`**: Local Ollama models now get the same pre-flight validation as `classify()` — checks that Ollama is running, verifies the model is available, offers auto-download for missing models, and warns about system resources. New `auto_download` parameter on both functions.
- **Single-label classification mode** (`multi_label=False` in `classify()`): Switches from the default multi-label mode (multiple categories can be 1) to single-label mode (exactly one best category gets 1, all others 0). Only the prompt text changes — JSON schema, parsing, validation, ensemble consensus, and DataFrame output format are all unchanged. Works with all input types (text, PDF, image), all prompting strategies (CoT, context prompt, step-back), and batch mode.
- **Ensemble batch mode (experimental)**: `batch_mode=True` now works with multi-model ensembles. Each model submits its own batch job concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor`; results are merged through the existing `aggregate_results` + `build_output_dataframes` pipeline and return the same DataFrame format as synchronous ensemble mode (per-model columns, `_consensus`, `_agreement`). Providers without a batch API (HuggingFace, Perplexity, Ollama) fall back to synchronous calls automatically. Prints an `[CatLLM] NOTE: experimental` warning when used.
  - New internal helpers: `_run_one_batch_job` (extracted from `run_batch_classify`), `_run_one_sync_model` (sync fallback), and `run_batch_ensemble_classify` (orchestrator) in `src/cat_stack/_batch.py`.
- **Embedding-based similarity scores** (`embeddings=True` in `classify()`): Adds `category_N_similarity` columns (0–1 float) alongside the binary 0/1 classification columns. Uses a local sentence-transformer model (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`, 33M params, ~130MB) to compute cosine similarity between each input text and each category. Requires `pip install cat-llm[embeddings]`.
  - New parameters: `embeddings` (bool, default `False`) and `category_descriptions` (dict, default `None` — optional richer text per category for improved similarity, e.g. `{"Financial reasons (...)": "The person moved because of money, high rent, ..."}`).
  - Scores are independent per (text, category) pair — no softmax across categories. Works with single-model and ensemble modes. Skipped automatically for PDF/image input. Model downloaded from HuggingFace Hub on first use.
  - New internal module: `src/cat_stack/_embeddings.py`. New optional dependency group: `[embeddings]` (installs `sentence-transformers`).
- **`json_formatter=True` in `classify()`**: Opt-in local JSON formatter fallback that uses a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-0.5B model to fix malformed classification JSON before marking responses as failed. The formatter only runs when `extract_json()` produces invalid output — zero cost on the happy path. On first use, the model (~1GB) is downloaded from HuggingFace Hub ([chrissoria/catllm-json-formatter](https://huggingface.co/chrissoria/catllm-json-formatter)). Requires `pip install cat-llm[formatter]`.
- **`src/cat_stack/_formatter.py`**: New internal module with `ensure_formatter_available()`, `load_formatter()`, and `run_formatter()` functions for the JSON formatter fallback.
- **`[formatter]` optional dependency group**: `pip install cat-llm[formatter]` installs `torch`, `transformers`, and `accelerate`.

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-03-05

### Added
- **`batch_mode=True` in `classify()`**: New async batch inference mode that reduces API costs by 50% and bypasses standard rate limits. Supported providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (Gemini), Mistral, and xAI (Grok). Not supported: HuggingFace, Perplexity, Ollama.
  - Packages all classification requests as a JSONL file, submits a single batch job, polls for completion, and returns a DataFrame identical in format to the synchronous single-model path.
  - New parameters: `batch_poll_interval` (seconds between polls, default 30) and `batch_timeout` (max wait in seconds, default 86400 = 24h).
  - Incompatible with multi-model ensemble (`models` list with >1 entry), PDF/image input, and `progress_callback`.
  - Returns the same simplified DataFrame format as synchronous single-model mode: `category_1`, `category_2`, ... columns with no model suffix, consensus, or agreement columns.
- **`BatchJobExpiredError`**: New exception raised when a batch job expires or is cancelled. Includes the job ID for provider dashboard lookup.
- **`BatchJobFailedError`**: New exception raised when a batch job terminates in a failed state.
- **`src/cat_stack/_batch.py`**: New internal module implementing all batch logic (JSONL building, file upload, job creation, polling, result download and parsing) for all five supported providers via pure HTTP — no provider SDKs required.

### Fixed
- **Google (Gemini) batch**: Switched from file-upload to inline requests format; fixed terminal state names (`BATCH_STATE_SUCCEEDED` not `JOB_STATE_SUCCEEDED`); fixed result extraction path (`response.inlinedResponses.inlinedResponses`); fixed response ordering — Google returns results out of order, so responses are now mapped via `metadata.key` rather than positional index. Verified: ≤0.3pp accuracy delta vs synchronous calls.
- **Mistral batch**: Fixed response parsing — Mistral wraps the completion inside `response.body`, mirroring the OpenAI envelope. Verified: ≤0.4pp accuracy delta vs synchronous calls.

### Changed
- `CERAD_functions.py`: Refactored `cerad_drawn_score()` to call `classify()` directly instead of the deprecated `image_multi_class()`. All scoring logic unchanged.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **`has_other_category()` utility**: New function in `cat_stack._category_analysis` that detects whether a category list contains a catch-all / "Other" category. Uses a two-tier heuristic (anchored patterns for exact matches, phrase patterns for short categories) with an optional LLM fallback for ambiguous cases.
- **`add_other` parameter in `classify()`**: Automatically detects when categories lack a catch-all "Other" option and prompts the user to add one. Supports three modes: `"prompt"` (default, interactive), `True` (silent), `False` (disabled). Including an "Other" category improves accuracy by giving models an outlet for ambiguous responses.
- **`check_category_verbosity()` utility**: New function that uses a single LLM call to assess whether each category has a description and examples. Returns per-category flags (`has_description`, `has_examples`, `is_verbose`).
- **`check_verbosity` parameter in `classify()`**: Alerts users when categories lack descriptions or examples (1 API call). Verbose categories with descriptions and examples improve accuracy by ~7 pp over bare labels. Default `True`.
- **Evidence-based prompting strategy warnings**: `classify()` now prints informational warnings when users enable strategies that empirical evidence shows are ineffective or harmful for structured classification:
  - `chain_of_verification=True`: WARNING — degrades accuracy by ~2 pp, costs 4x API calls.
  - Few-shot examples (`example1`–`example6`): NOTE — degrades accuracy by ~1 pp, amplifies over-classification.
  - `thinking_budget > 0`: NOTE — negligible gains, high failure rates, massive latency increase.
  - `chain_of_thought=True`: NOTE — no measurable effect on accuracy.
  - `step_back_prompt=True`: NOTE — small/inconsistent gains, hurts top-tier models, 2x cost.

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **NaN row handling in classify()**: Skipped rows (NaN input) no longer falsely list all models as failed. Previously, NaN inputs generated fake error results for every model, causing `failed_models` to contain all model names. Now skipped rows correctly show empty `failed_models` and NaN category values.

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Schema validation in aggregate_results**: Responses with at least one valid category key (0/1 value) are accepted, but invalid keys are now stripped before storing — prevents garbage values like `"yes"` from silently becoming phantom 0 votes in consensus.
- **Failed model output**: Failed models now produce `None`/NA in output CSVs instead of silent zeros, in both `_save_partial_results()` and `build_output_dataframes()`.
- **Batch retry detection**: Schema validation applied consistently to detect failures and verify retry success.

### Added
- **Missing keys tracking**: `aggregate_results()` now returns `missing_keys` counts per model, and a classification quality summary is printed after classification completes.

---

## [2.3.4] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **HuggingFace thinking support**: Models that reason by default (e.g., Qwen3) can now be controlled via `thinking_budget=0`, which sends `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": False}` to disable thinking mode. HuggingFace providers now correctly receive `thinking_budget` through the payload pipeline.
- **OpenAI reasoning model detection**: Added `gpt-5` to reasoning model prefix list alongside o1/o3/o4. Simplified temperature handling — reasoning models never set temperature (only default=1 is valid).

### Changed
- **Consolidated duplicate `UnifiedLLMClient`**: Removed ~930 lines of duplicated provider infrastructure from `text_functions.py`. `_providers.py` is now the single source of truth; `text_functions.py` re-exports all names for backward compatibility.
- **Added `ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Module dependency map and `classify()` call chain showing where each function and prompting strategy originates.

---

## [2.3.3] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Critical: Thinking support was applied to wrong module** — v2.3.2 fixes were only applied to `_providers.py`, but the classify pipeline imports `UnifiedLLMClient` from `text_functions.py`. All three provider fixes now applied to both modules.
- **Google thinking support**: Fixed `thinkingConfig` placement in `text_functions.py` — must be inside `generationConfig`, not at the top level. Added minimum budget of 128 tokens.
- **OpenAI reasoning support**: `reasoning_effort` now only applied to reasoning models (o1, o3, o4-series). Regular models like gpt-4o skip this parameter gracefully.
- **Anthropic thinking support**: Extended thinking + forced `tool_choice` are incompatible — now uses `tool_choice: "auto"` when thinking is enabled. Also added temperature=1 requirement and minimum budget of 1024 tokens.

---

## [2.3.2] - 2026-02-10

### Fixed
- **Google thinking support**: Fixed `thinkingConfig` placement — must be inside `generationConfig`, not at the top level. Added minimum budget of 128 tokens.
- **OpenAI reasoning support**: Fixed conflict between `reasoning_effort` and `temperature` — temperature is now omitted when reasoning is enabled (`thinking_budget > 0`).
- **Anthropic thinking support**: Temperature is now set to 1 (Anthropic requirement) when extended thinking is enabled, instead of using the user-specified creativity value.

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-02-10

### Changed
- **Extraction defaults updated**: `divisions` changed from 5 to **12** and `iterations` changed from 3 to **8** for `extract()`, `explore()`, and the `main.py` wrapper. These new defaults were determined through empirical analysis: a 6x6 grid search over both parameters (10 repeats per cell, 360 total runs) showed that extraction consistency peaks at 12 divisions and 8 iterations, with no meaningful improvement beyond this point.

---

## [2.3.0] - 2026-02-08

### Added
- **`explore()` function**: New entry point for raw category extraction — returns every category string from every chunk across every iteration, with duplicates intact. Useful for analyzing category stability and building saturation curves.
- `return_raw` parameter on `explore_common_categories()` to support raw output mode

---

## [2.2.0] - 2025-02-08

### Added
- **Unified `classify()` API**: Added 9 missing parameters (`survey_question`, `use_json_schema`, `max_workers`, `fail_strategy`, `max_retries`, `batch_retries`, `retry_delay`, `pdf_dpi`, `auto_download`) — `classify()` is now the single entry point for all classification
- **4-tuple model format**: `(model, provider, api_key, {"creativity": 0.5})` for per-model temperature control in ensembles
- **Image/PDF auto-category extraction**: `categories="auto"` now works for images and PDFs via routing through `extract()`, not just text
- **Retry logic for image extraction**: Exponential backoff (6 attempts) for `call_model_with_image()` and `describe_image_with_vision()`
- `progress_callback` support for real-time progress tracking

### Fixed
- **Agreement calculation**: Now measures fraction of models agreeing with consensus (was incorrectly measuring fraction voting 1)
- **MIME type for Anthropic**: Normalized `image/jpg` to `image/jpeg` in `_encode_image()`, fixing 400 errors on Anthropic image API calls
- Removed dead duplicate `classify()` from `main.py`

### Changed
- HuggingFace Space app now uses `classify()` instead of `classify_ensemble()` directly
- All example/test scripts updated to use `classify()` API

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-01-17

### Major Release: Simplified API & Ensemble Methods

Version 2.0 represents a major simplification of CatLLM's architecture and API, making it easier to install, use, and extend.

### Added
- **Ensemble classification**: Run multiple models in parallel and combine predictions
  - Cross-provider ensembles (GPT-4o + Claude + Gemini)
  - Self-consistency ensembles (same model with temperature variation)
  - Model comparison mode for side-by-side evaluation
- **Consensus voting methods**:
  - `"majority"` - 50%+ agreement required
  - `"two-thirds"` - 67%+ agreement required
  - `"unanimous"` - 100% agreement required
  - Custom numeric thresholds (e.g., `0.75` for 75%)
- **Visualization tools** in web app:
  - Classification matrix heatmap
  - Category distribution charts
  - Download buttons for all visualizations
- PDF report generation with methodology documentation

### Changed
- **Simplified to 3 core functions**:
  - `extract()` - Discover categories in your data
  - `classify()` - Assign categories to your data
  - `summarize()` - Generate summaries of your data
- **Removed SDK dependencies**: All API calls now use pure `requests` library
  - No more `openai`, `anthropic`, `google-generativeai` package requirements
  - Lighter installation, fewer dependency conflicts
  - Unified HTTP interface for all providers
- **Streamlined parameters**: Consistent parameter names across all functions
- Web app UI improvements: button alignment, Garamond font, improved layout

### Removed
- Direct SDK dependencies (openai, anthropic, google-generativeai, mistralai)
- Legacy function names (old aliases still work but are deprecated)

### Migration from 1.x
Most code will work without changes. Key differences:
- SDK-specific features (like streaming) are no longer available
- All providers now use the same HTTP-based interface
- New `models` parameter enables ensemble mode
